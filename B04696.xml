            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE Petitioners CASE OF THE Corporation of <hi>ORFORD</hi> in <hi>SUFFOLK.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THIS Burrough is an Antient Corporation, but sends Burgesses to Parliament by Prescription and not by Charter, and the Elections have always been by the Freemen of the Burrough, as well as by the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Corporation.</p>
            <p>They were formerly incorporated by the Name of <hi>Proborum Hominum,</hi> and after Grants were by the Name of Burgesses; but in the <hi>21th</hi> Year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> they changed their Name of Incorporation, and were incorporated by the Name of <hi>Mayor</hi> and <hi>Commonalty;</hi> and in that Charter it's said, The <hi>Mayor,</hi> Eight <hi>Portmen,</hi> and Twelve <hi>Chief Burgesses</hi> shall be the <hi>Mayor</hi> and <hi>Commonalty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And since the Revolution, under this Umbrage have endeavoured to Chuse Burgesses to Parliament by this Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect Number of 21. and would shut out all the Freemen and Inhabitants, which are more than three times their Number; and by this way of Chusing, the present Members are pretended to be Elected and Returned.</p>
            <p>Which is contrary to all the Antient Usage, for the Elections have always been by the Freemen as well as by the Members of the Corporation: And this will be fully proved by living Witnesses, by Antient and Modern Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns, and by the Town-Books.</p>
            <p>But if the Select Number were the true Electors, the Petitioners (and not the Sitting Members) were duly Elected, for the Petitioners have the Majority of the true Select Number, who are the Rightful Officers of the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1693. there being some Vacancies in the <hi>Portmen</hi> and <hi>Chief Burgesses,</hi> those were filled up with Men that were not liked by one <hi>Thomas Hastings,</hi> who has long pretended to the Government of the Town (and under whose Interest the present sitting Members are Chosen) upon which the said <hi>Hastings</hi> and his Accomplices broke open the Town-Chest, and took away the Charters, and all the Town-Books and Evidence.</p>
            <p>And at <hi>Michaelmas</hi> 1693. they set up by themselves, and <hi>Thomas Hastings</hi> pretended to be Chosen Mayor, and he Chose his Brother <hi>Joseph Hastings</hi> Justice, tho' at the same time <hi>Thomas Palmer</hi> was duly Chosen Mayor by the true Electors, and <hi>Richard Gooding,</hi> the former Mayor, was Justice; And afterwards the said <hi>Hastings</hi> (to terrifie and affright the Legal Officers from Acting) procur'd an Information to be brought against <hi>Palmer,</hi> the right Mayor, and against <hi>Richard Gooding,</hi> the Mayor of the Year before, and against divers others, for Holding Courts, and Filling up those Vacancies, and Acting in the Corporation, and to load them with infinite Charge, they procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the then Attorney-General to insist on the King's Prerogative to try this Information at the Bar, and accordingly it was Try'd at the King's Bench Bar in <hi>Trinity Term</hi> 1694. and the Defts justified themselves upon the Tryal to be Legal Officers, and that the Court they kept to fill up the Vacancies was Legal; and were found not Guilty. Which cost the <hi>Defendants</hi> in the Information 200 <hi>l.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Afterwards an Action was brought against <hi>Joseph Hastings,</hi> the pretended Justice, for Imprisonning one <hi>Marri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t,</hi> on purpose to bring the Legality of <hi>Thomas Hastings</hi>'s Pretence of being Mayor in Question; and that was Try'd before the Lord Chief Justice <hi>Holt</hi> in 1694. And upon the Tryal the sole Question was, Whether <hi>Thomas Palmer</hi> or <hi>Thomas Hastings</hi> was Rightful Mayor, and the Verdict went for the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> in that Action, That <hi>Palmer</hi> was Rightful Mayor.</p>
            <p>And at the same time an Information was Try'd against <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Joseph Hastings,</hi> for breaking open the Town-Hall and Chest, and taking away the <hi>Charters,</hi> &amp;c. and they pretended to justifie upon the Tryal, because <hi>Thomas Hastings</hi> was Mayor, and <hi>Joseph Hastings</hi> was Justice; and upon full Evidence they were Convicted; and then the Court of <hi>King's Bench</hi> was moved to make them deliver the <hi>Charter</hi>'s <hi>Books, Mace,</hi> and other En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs of Government, before they set their Fine, which the Court declared they should do; but, to prevent this, the then Attorney-General enter'd a <hi>Noli Prosequi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And notwithstanding these <hi>three</hi> Verdicts against the Legality of their pretended Officers, they have ever since pretended to call Courts, and Chuse Officers, and kept up a separate Sett of Officers in the Corporation; and by this illegal Sett of Officers are the present sitting Members Chosen and Returned, they having a Power with the Sheriffs, and having got the Precept into their pretended Mayor's Hands, who broke open the Town-Hall, and there pretended to make this Election. But the Petitioners appear'd, and had a Majority of the Rightful Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, even of the select Number as well as of the Freemen, so that either way the Petitioners are in the right.</p>
